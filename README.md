This folder contains both the binary and source files for the tool "PBnJ" (Plan B in Java) as explained in the paper "Falling Back on Executable Specifications":
https://www.hesam.us/cs/planb/index.html

- Use the binary folder pbnj-bin if you only intend to try and use the tool.
- Use the source folder pbnj-src if you intend to build & modify the tool yourself from the raw source files.
