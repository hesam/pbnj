The PBnJ Compiler
=================

This software distribution contains an extension to Polyglot compiler
framework (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot) that adds
support for the PBnJ extension to Java.  Information about the PBnJ
language is available here:

https://www.hesam.us/cs/planb/index.html

The PBnJ compiler extends an existing extension to the Polyglot
compiler, which adds support for Java 1.5 language features.  A
jarfile of that extension is included in this distribution; that
project is maintained here:

http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~milanst/projects/polyglot5/


This software is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence,

directory.


Requirements
-----------

* The compiler is written in Java, so to run (and build) it you need
  to have a virtual machine (and compiler) for Java 5 or greater
  installed.  Make sure that the java and javac commands are available
  in your PATH.

* If you are running Windows, you should use cygwin to build the PBnJ
  compiler and the auxiliary tools it requires:

  http://www.cygwin.com

* If you want to build the compiler, you will need Apache Ant, which
  can be found here:

  http://ant.apache.org

  Make sure that the ant command is available in your PATH.

* Finally, the compiler relies on several Java libraries, including
  the Polyglot compiler, the extension to Polyglot for Java 1.5, the
  JFlex scanner generator, and the CUP parser generator.  Jar files
  for these libraries are included as part of this distribution, in
  the lib directory.

Building
-------

In the top-level directory of the compiler, invoke ant:

$ ant

This will compile the compiler, placing the resulting .class files in
the classes directory, and it will also create the jar file pbnj.jar
in the lib directory.

You can create an executable script to run the compiler by invoking:

$ ant bin

This will create the script jlc in the bin directory.  Make sure to
add the bin directory to your PATH.

Running the compiler via the command line
----------------------------------

You can now invoke the compiler on a file File.pbj as follows:

$ jlc -assert -ext pbnj File.pbj 

If the file typechecks, the compiler will create a file File.java
containing the translation of the PBnJ code to Java.  It will then
use the javac compiler to compile File.java to bytecode.  (This last
step can be omitted with the -c flag.)

To see command line options, just type jlc.

If you don't want to use the script, you can run the compiler directly
by adding the libraries pbnj.jar, jl5.jar, polyglot.jar,
java_cup.jar, and JFlex.jar from the lib directory to your CLASSPATH
and then invoking the following command:

$ java polyglot.main.Main -ext pbnj File.pbj

There are a lot of test files in the tests directory.  For each .pbj,
there is a corresponding .pbj-expected file, which contains the
expected error messages output by the compiler, as well as a
.java-expected file, which contains the expected Java code output by
the compiler as a .java file.
